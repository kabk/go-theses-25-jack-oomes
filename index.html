          This thesis explores the relationship between Buddhism and western
          culture, with an emphasis on the misunderstandings that often occurs.
          By following the way in which Buddhism was established in the west,
          this research aims to understand which cultural and historical events
          have contributed to shaping this misconception. Besides this
          conceptual outcome, this research aims to understand the role of
          representation in forming a perception, and reflects on iconography in
          my own contemporary — Dutch and western — culture.

      <h2 class="chaptertitle">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p class="selfpara">
        Like many others, Buddhism helped me gain insights on my emotional and
        inner life. At the same time, I don’t consider myself a Buddhist as I am
        not committed to its rituals. Still, Buddhist teachings have meant a lot
        to me. Therefore, in this thesis I want to keep on exploring its
        knowledge in the same manner as I did before, by listening. I don’t want
        to classify Buddhism nor incorporate it, I only aim to listen to what
        its teachings have to say. In order to understand my own position in
        relation to Buddhism, I think it’ll be appropriate to start with the
        relation between the tradition and my own western culture. I was born
        and still live in Amsterdam. In my surroundings I tend to notice
        references to Buddhism almost every day. The misunderstanding — through
        commercialisation and trivialisation — that often occurs seemed like a
        fitting starting point. I aim to research what were significant sources
        of influence in the origination of this misunderstanding, on a
        conceptual and visual level. As an art academy student, I obviously
        don’t have the academic background from which I can offer a detailed
        timeline of the complex history between Buddhism and the west. I — of
        course — can’t cover every aspect of the story. Therefore, all I’m
        trying to do is grasp a connection between the references to Buddhism
        that I tend to notice and its origins in western culture, in order to
        understand the things I come across. <br></br>
        As a graphic designer, I think it’s interesting how perceptions
        originate and what role representation fulfils, in the process of
        creating a frame of reference. Since I can’t look into someone’s
        interiority, perceptions always imply that I can never exactly define
        it. Still, I think most would agree that there is something as a
        collective perception in the west, something that is defined by culture
        and based on representation. This is based on a shared way of thinking
        present in my environment. In <span class="italics">Buen Vivir: Relationality and the Task of
        Listening</span> (2012), Rolando Vázquez refers to this collective way of
        western thinking as <span class="italics">modernity</span>. Although, many individuals in the west
        don’t think and act in line with this framework, I do believe that the
        worldview which <span class="italics">modernity</span> entails is somewhat dominant in my culture.<br></br>
        The term modernity entails a claim of being the only worldview with
        access to universal “truth”. Since the enlightenment, this idea has been
        deeply ingrained in the west, and is employed to maintain its position
        of power in the world. Through scientific notions, modernity seeks to
        validate this universality, as science is believed to determine what is
        “objectively true” <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Together with representation as seen in the media
        and design, science is used as a method to create meaning and ideas. It
        can create the impression in one’s mind, that it is per definition
        “right”. It creates perception. Since modernity pretends as if it is the
        only valid way of gaining knowledge, other worldviews are being excluded
        and denied, a process that Vázquez refers to as <span class="italics">coloniality.</span><sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-2" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> These
        principles are crucial in this thesis, because it researches just that:
        worldviews different from the dominant one of modernity and how these
        can be appropriated. By opening spaces for other perspectives stemming
        from ‘outside of <span class="italics"></span>modernity</span>’ — In the case of <span class="italics">buen vivir</span>, an indigenous
        notion present in the political discourse of Bolivia and Ecuador —
        Vázquez criticises the western pretension of owning universal “truth” by
        listening to ideas from a different background than modernity.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-3" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> In the
        same vein I aim to research and question western assumptions and
        perceptions on Buddhism. Considering my non-academic background, I don’t
        seek to find any absolute answers. All I have is a train of thought that
        I want to follow. This research does not aim to conclude anything.<br></br>

      <h2 class="chaptertitle">2. Foundation of the Tradition</h2>
      <p class="selfpara">
        Buddhist tradition revolves around an in-depth research on the ‘self’,
        through a way of thinking and living one needs to commit to. Opinions
        might differ on how to categorise Buddhism. Generally speaking, I think
        a religion based on a philosophy can serve as an explanation that comes
        close to its entirety. When Siddhartha Gautama (est. 566 BCE–486 BCE)
        got enlightened and became <span class="italics">the Buddha</span>, he shaped a solution for <span class="italics">Dukkha</span>,
        or suffering.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-4" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> Suffering is often defined as mental and emotional pain or
        dissatisfaction. Gautama reached <span class="italics">Nirvana</span> — a state free of all suffering
        and full of satisfaction and insight — through several fundamental
        insights, which form the core of Buddhist teachings. These insights are
        called the <span class="italics">‘Four Noble Truths’</span>.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-5" href="#fn-5">5</a></sup> <span class="italics">‘The truth of suffering’</span>: Suffering is
        an unavoidable part of life. When reaching Nirvana, you escape from life
        and so from suffering. Stemming from the idea that life is cyclical,
        accepting life as it is, is essential in breaking from the cycle of life
        and death. <span class="italics">‘The truth of the origin of suffering’</span>: Suffering originates
        from desire — wanting or wishing for something to happen or not to
        happen — a craving that originates within. <span class="italics">’The truth of cessation of
        suffering’</span>: Ignorance about the nature of the self. This ignorance is a
        misconception in which people tend to assume they’re something absolute
        and independent. According to Buddhist beliefs the ‘self’ is a mental
        construct. Therefore, the Buddha speaks about a non-self: <span class="italics">Anatta</span>. To
        clarify on this term, I understand the ‘non-self’ to be that voice that
        speaks in the ‘me-form’. I experience, I think, I am. Conscious of
        itself as if separated from its surroundings. According to the Buddha,
        the physical and mental self is something continuously changing and
        consists of endless processes. Something that is connected to the rest
        of the world, part of a whole rather than a fixed entity. When one
        desires, one believes in fulfilling something that can never be
        absolute. Therefore, one is trying to feed something that doesn’t really
        exist. When gaining this insight and ignorance is removed, one will be
        able to detach oneself from desire.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-6" href="#fn-6">6</a></sup> The fourth truth is <span class="italics">’The truth of
        the Path’</span>: <span class="italics">the Noble Eightfold path</span>, a guide that turns the past three
        insights to action.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-7" href="#fn-7">7</a></sup> <br></br></p>
      
        <p class="selfpara">
        In Buddhist tradition, the notion of an
        interconnected self is a key aspect. As stated in the <span class="italics">‘the truth of
        cessation of suffering’</span>, understanding this is fundamental for escaping
        from suffering. Besides this and the other Noble Truths, Buddhism — of
        course — encompasses much more. Its versatility expresses itself in the
        variety of approaches. These are taught at Buddhist schools and temples,
        a process one needs to commit to. The Theravada and Mahayana are the two
        largest schools. Two overarching approaches from which new approaches
        flow. Mahayana developed in the north, while Theravāda Buddhism spread
        in the south <span class="italics">(Figure 1)</span>.
        <br></br>
        In many places where Buddhism gained a
        substantial following, traditions and approach adapted. Missionaries
        showed the capability of transforming and embracing local ideas and
        practices.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-8" href="#fn-8">8</a></sup> In China, Taoism and Confucianism merged with Buddhism and
        turned into Chan-Buddhism. In Japan, Chan-Buddhism merged with the local
        Japanese culture and turned into Zen-Buddhism. And so, many other Asian
        countries and regions shaped their own forms. Eventually in the west,
        expressions of modernity like secularism, individualism and
        “rationality” needed to be emphasised in order to adapt. Or, in order to
        be acknowledged. According to David L. McMahan, this hybrid became so
        different to its root that <span class="italics">Buddhist Modernism</span> would be more of a fitting
        term.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-9" href="#fn-9">9</a></sup>

      <h2 class="subchaptertitle">Early Encounters</h2>
      <p class="selfpara">
        In the early 19th century, information on Buddhism was particularly
        gained through academics and missionaries who visited colonised land.
        One can use Edward Said’s concept of <span class="italics">Orientalism</span> to describe how these
        encounters created simplistic and stereotypical views on non-European
        cultures.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-10" href="#fn-10">10</a></sup> <span class="italics">Orientalism</span> entails the othering view of Middle Easterners.
        Meaning, <span class="italics">the Orient</span> was a place lacking ‘enlightenment’. Moreover, the
        depictions of ‘oriental’ cultures were shallow and one-dimensional, as
        if they missed “civilisation”. Even though Said discusses the Middle
        East, this concept can also be applied to encounters between European
        and Asiatic cultures, like Buddhist tradition. Europeans were placing
        themselves at the top of the hierarchy and from there categorising a
        normal ‘us’ and a different ‘them’. Dominance was prioritised and
        co-realised by forcing these ideas onto culture: ideologies from which
        colonial actions could be justified. Regions under colonial rule were
        seen as a project, something one could build up and engage with
        according to one’s vision, something that’s up for observation.
        <br></br></p>
        <p class="selfpara">
         The
        first Christian translators of Buddhist text mainly presented it as
        something that should be replaced by Christianity.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-11" href="#fn-11">11</a></sup> Another
        interpretation that stems from these times came from scholars who wanted
        to know what colonised land had to offer. The translation of Buddhist
        texts was done very poorly as they weren’t aware of the cultural
        differences that gave value to these texts. This misunderstanding
        spilled over to other interested academics and philosophers. Reports on
        early encounters between the west and Buddhism formed a substantial part
        of the — back then considered — reliable information. As a reaction to
        the colonial depiction, in some regions the tradition was forced to
        present itself in a different manner. One that adapted to a western
        worldview based on “rationality”. In order to be acknowledged and fit
        this framework, Buddhists often presented their beliefs as based on
        reason and philosophy, a research in which religious aspects — such as
        the belief in afterlife — became latent.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-12" href="#fn-12">12</a></sup> Even though this positioning
        was forced, eventually — along with many westerners — Asian Buddhists
        took on this adaptation as the tradition got introduced to the west.

      <h2 class="subchaptertitle">"rationality"</h2>
      <p class="selfpara">
        In the 19th century the ideas of the enlightenment were establishing
        itself as the backbone of western thinking. With science being its main
        tool, “truth” was found through reason. This supposedly objective way of
        finding truth was of course highly ideological, containing many western
        biases. The mentality of westerners being at the top of a hierarchy was
        backed by a self-claimed patent on “knowledge”. One can only divide fact
        from fiction through empirical observation. Anything that falls outside
        this systematic worldview could be regarded as impossible to verify,
        like worldviews which aren’t considered as “rational” for example. In a
        society that grows from this ideology, there can be very limited space
        for other notions, their worldview is regarded as the only “rational”
        one and therefore the only one that should be taken seriously. 
        <br></br></p>
        <p class="selfpara">
        The cold “rationality” and mechanistic thinking of the enlightenment left a void
        for those who felt that individual experience was downplayed by this
        one-sided worldview. Romanticism is an artistic and philosophical
        movement that flourished in Europe between the late 18th and mid-19th
        century, it arose as a reaction against the empiricism of the

      <p class="selfpara">
        Spirituality is an ambiguous term and just like Buddhism, it entails a
        worldview different from that of modernity because of ideas about an
        interconnected world. In order to clarify, author and activist bell
        hooks explains spirituality in a way that seems adequate:<span class="italics"> “spiritual
        life is first and foremost about commitment to a way of thinking and
        behaving that honours principles of inter-being and interconnectedness.
        When I speak of the spiritual, I refer to the recognition within
        everyone that there is a place of mystery in our lives where forces that
        are beyond human desire or will alter circumstances and/or guide and
        direct us. I call these forces “divine spirit”. When we choose to lead a
        spirit-filled life, we recognise and celebrate the presence of
        transcendent spirits. Some people call this presence soul, God, the
        Beloved, higher consciousness, or higher power. Still others say that
        this force is what it is because it cannot be named. To them it is
        simply the spirit moving in us and through us”.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-16" href="#fn-16">16</a></sup></span><br></br> In the course of the
        19th century — as a reaction to the ever spreading belief in modernity
        and science — interest in spiritual practices gained popularity.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-17" href="#fn-17">17</a></sup> Terms
        such as ‘spirituality’ and ‘mysticism’ became conceptual equivalents of
        the scientific notion of empirical observation and their “truth” claims.
        What was considered spiritual became a blend of everything that in some
        way opposed scientific thought. The result was not only a rising
        interest in Eastern “exoticism”, but also in spiritual practices with a
        western background, such as esoteric traditions and “the occult”.
        <br></br> </p>
        <p class="selfpara">A
        trendy example of this interest in “spiritualism” or “the occult”
        coexisted mainly among the British and Americans. In this context,
        <span class="italics">séances</span> — communal events in which the supernatural and other phenomenas
        associated with spirituality were explored — were a common social
        activity.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-18" href="#fn-18">18</a></sup> In a less popularised manner, this “spiritual
        hunger” manifested itself in a way that is more aligned with the
        commitment bell hooks explained. Artists like Hilma af Klint, Georgina
        Houghton and Emma Kunz explored their own inner lives and experiences,
        as they were involved in séances and found inspiration in esoteric
        traditions. Klint for example, took interest in Rosicrucianism and
        Theosophy <span class="italics">(figure 3 and 4)</span>.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-19" href="#fn-19">19</a></sup> Through this research she tried to make the
        invisible, visible. Klint was one of the first artists to turn this
        personal research into art, expressing it through symbolism. She was one
        of the first abstract painters but never got the same recognition as
        others like Kandinsky and Mondriaan. Klint was convinced that when she
        painted, she was in contact with beings of a higher level of
        consciousness, these entities used her as a medium. Her work is based on
        her experience that the spiritual dimension of human experience has
        become more and more marginalised in an increasingly materialistic
        world.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-20" href="#fn-20">20</a></sup><br></br>

        People got interested in forms of exploring spirituality, and the
        door was kept open through perceptions of Romantic philosophers. Direct
        and indirect successors of Romantic thought — such as Theosophy and
        Transcendentalism — were well-informed by this perception of Buddhism
        and other Asian religions.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-21" href="#fn-21">21</a></sup> Therefore, the language these philosophical
        movements spoke was familiar ground for people such as D.T. Suzuki — a
        crucial monk in the introduction of Zen-Buddhism to America in the early
        20th century — responded to this linguistic framework by translating
        Buddhism to fit this context. He described Zen as the pure unmediated
        experience of reality and the spontaneous living in harmony with that
        reality, with mystical experience as its essence.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-22" href="#fn-22">22</a></sup> In Buddhisms
        adaptation to the west some presented it as a tradition that overlapped
        with western “rational” research. At the same time, Buddhism remained a
        reputation that overlapped with the western search for mysticism as
        well. Depending on who took interest, it became compatible with various
        interpretations and needs.

      <p class="selfpara">
        The post-war period in the west is marked by upcoming economic
        prosperity and consumerism. Many began to distrust a society with a
        tunnel vision for growth and desire. The hippies looked for detachment
        from materialistic western standards. In their search, spiritual
        practices and Asian religions became a source of inspiration.
        Just like Theosophical philosophers in the 19th century. The hippies
        took an interest in Indian religions with a sentiment comparable to that
        of the Romantics. It was common for participants of this subculture to
        take trips to Tibet and India for spiritual inspiration, and famous
        names — like Jack Kerouac and The Beats — promoted their interest in
        Zen-Buddhism to the youth.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-23" href="#fn-23">23</a></sup> In their revolt against social standards,
        exploring one’s consciousness was an important theme. 
        <br></br></p>
        <p class="selfpara">
        In this rebellion
        against the establishment, drugs became a somewhat normalised method of
        researching one’s consciousness. Today, drugs can still be taken
        seriously as a mental research method. The visual effect of LSD became
        part of the way in which the hippies represented themselves. This is
        reflected in posters, a medium that presented them to the mass <span class="italics">(figure
        5)</span>. Intense colours and vivid patterns combined with characteristics of
        nature and abstract shapes. Mainly in America, many artists experimented
        with altered states of being through drugs and spiritual practices,
        before and during the hippie movement. This led to two overlapping
        branches in art called <span class="italics">psychedelic</span> and <span class="italics">visionary art</span> <span class="italics">(figure 6)</span>. Both
        implicate experienced-based research methods, only in psychedelic art
        there is an emphasis on hallucinogenic drugs. Psychedelic art is often a
        visualisation of the experience gained through a trip. Visionary art
        revolves more around a spiritual research, often based on Asian
        religions and other forms of esoteric traditions. Even though drug use
        can be included in this research, the emphasis isn’t necessarily on
        drugs. It’s rather a part of researching ones spirituality.

        <p class="selfpara">Artists like
          Harry Smith, Richard Aldcroft, Francis Lee and James Whitney were
          already pioneering the psychedelic style before the hippies <span class="italics">(figure 7)</span>.
          Whitney for example, aimed to convey inner consciousness through
          meditative techniques, creating a similar visual effect to
          hallucinogenics. He was inspired by Far Eastern metaphysics and
          contributed to the spiritual and artistic tradition that had given rise
          to abstract painting in the early twentieth century.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-24" href="#fn-24">24</a></sup> Even though the
          hippies shared their experiences gained through drugs and spiritual
          practices with the broader world, Author of the book <span class="italics">Are You
          Experienced?</span> (2011), Ken Jones, speaks about how pop-psychedelic culture pushed
          the limits of collective imagination in the ‘60s, and how this continued
          in the following decades.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-25" href="#fn-25">25</a></sup> Therefore, because of its overlap with
          spiritual practices — which became somewhat of a container term that
          encompasses drugs, esoteric traditions and Asian religions by now — it
          has had a huge impact on the iconography connected to the umbrella term
          of: “spirituality”.

      <h2 class="subchaptertitle">New Age Imagery</h2>
      <p class="selfpara">
        As presented by the hippie-culture, spirituality became a well-known
        concept in the west. However, it was only after the ‘80s that it became
        commercialised. An important source of influence for this new framing
        was New Age, which arose around the same time. Even though it’s an
        ambiguous and complex term, generally it can be considered an expansion
        of the counterculture from the ‘60s and early ‘70s. It believes that the
        self is sacred, even though those involved tend to believe that the
        world is one interconnected being, spirituality lies only within
        oneself. New Age can be considered as self-spirituality, therefore its
        not an organised entity.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-26" href="#fn-26">26</a></sup> This approach opens doors for a more
        individualistic approach towards spiritual practices. In the ‘70s <span class="italics">De
        Kosmos</span> in Amsterdam grew out to be one of the biggest New Age centres of
        the Netherlands. In their flyers, its clearly visible how events are
        organised with themes ranging between different traditions from all
        around the world <span class="italics">(figure 8)</span>. Undoubtedly, people benefited from this
        individualistic approach. However, this openness toward everything
        that’s perceived as spiritual can also lead to the appropriation of
        centuries of tradition, which can be the case with Buddhism. As one
        doesn’t need to commit to anything, complexity and depth can fade. In
        the context of consumerism, a logical consequence was that people began
        commercialising and branding the concept of “spirituality”. What’s
        supposed to be an in-depth research can become downgraded to a product.

        <span class="italics">“The crisis of American life does not seem to be generated by a lack of
        interest in spirituality. However, this interest is constantly co-opted
        by the powerful forces of materialism and hedonistic consumerism”.</span><sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-27" href="#fn-27">27</a></sup> This
        might as well be applied to my environment in some cases. The
        neighbourhood where I live — De Pijp — is generally known as a
        gentrified area in the Netherlands. When I look around, the outcome of
        this history becomes very clear. It seems like the current yoga,
        Self-help and social media trends are sometimes used more like a
        medicine. It seems more like a tool that improves the spiritual self for
        you. People try to fill up a need with a product, as if commitment is
        downplayed to a fast and easy solution. Like something that can be
        replaced with consumerism.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-28" href="#fn-28">28</a></sup> The ‘self’, inner life or sometimes even
        spirituality — whatever word it may be — it takes time and dedication to
        research. In Buddhist schools, monks study religious texts and
        meditation, as they commit to a research. Not to say that one must
        commit in the same manner in order to feel better but — as an anonymous
        speaker at the Chan-Buddhist <span class="italics">He Hua Temple</span> in Amsterdam told me — <span class="italics">“as
        long as there is depth you can turn it into a working instrument”.</span>
        <br></br></p>
        <p class="selfpara">
        Another possible consequence of this individualistic replacement works
        counterproductive to the <span class="italics">“honouring of principles of inter-being and
        interconnectedness”</span> hooks discussed. As research on the self can be
        transformed into the more popular term: Self-development. One could
        think it’s doing something healthy and so something to be proud of. <span class="italics">“It
        can boost the ‘self’ rather than it helps undermine it”</span> was explained to
        me at the Nyingma Centre located in Amsterdam. It could potentially
        expand separation from others by narcissism, the opposite of hooks’
        definition of spirituality. 
        <br></br></p>
        <p class="selfpara">Whether there’s depth or not, is something
        one can only judge for themselves. Otherwise, all that may be left is an
        extract. This concept can be applied to the branding of “spiritual”
        products for example. It illustrates how characteristics from Hilma af
        Klint to psychedelic art are implied. It’s a visual representation of
        the history of the concept of spirituality in the west, and how elements
        from different traditions and research methods are put into a single
        category <span class="italics">(figure 9)</span>. <br></br></p>

         <br></br> <p class="selfpara">Besides the <span class="italics">manifesting</span> trend as presented by
        Gabby Bernstein, social media is full of this extract as well. There’s
        one specific example I want to highlight in which many mentioned
        characteristics of this extract come together. The <span class="italics">Soulsisters.nl</span> is an
        Instagram account dedicated to “spiritual” practices run by two
        influencers. This “spiritual” podcast also organises events as shown in
        one of their posts. In this session, they blend “spiritual” expressions
        in the style of the New Age <span class="italics">(figure 10)</span>. Combining drugs — in the form
        of micro-dosing mushrooms — with Buddhist meditative poses. The
        packaging of the micro-dose portion up for purchase is branded with a
        symbol borrowed from a non-western religion: the ancient Egyptian symbol
        of <span class="italics"></span>the Eye of Horus</span>. I obviously can’t judge whether this session has
        had a positive effect, but after New Age and the hippies, I can’t ignore
        the origins of their branding decisions. Which — in an iconographic
        sense — is very widespread considering the billion dollar market behind
        Self-Help books alone <span class="italics">(figure 11)</span>.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-29" href="#fn-29">29</a></sup><br></br> </p>

        A comment on the same soulsisters.nl
        post — which I don’t prefer to include because of its content — embodies
        an attitude that this representation of “spiritual practices”
        co-creates. Cynical, as the commenter tags his friends in order to share
        this laugh. As if spirituality lost its meaning, due to representation.
        In an item of the podcast: <span class="italics">NRC Future Affairs</span>, the hosts discuss how
        certain associations lead to a skeptical attitude toward the term
        “spirituality” as well. For them, the idea of there being <span class="italics">something</span>
        through which everything is connected, makes associations with
        monotheistic religion arise. Which clashes with their western atheistic
        habituation. A notion fundamental for spirituality as hooks explained by
        mentioning a <span class="italics">“a divine spirit, soul, God or higher power”</span>. Obviously, I
        can’t know how individuals exactly perceive this term. However, even for
        me — based on past experiences when this topic was brought up — it feels
        like spirituality is often not taken seriously. It even feels like
        people feel alienated from ideas about <span class="italics">“how everything is connected”</span>.
        Whether by associations with something supernatural or by plain
        cynicism, spirituality often appears to be perceived as strange, or as
        <span class="italics">“vague and ambiguous”</span>.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-30" href="#fn-30">30</a></sup> An attitude that hinders openness to ideas
        different than that of modernity.

      <h2 class="chaptertitle">5. A Train of Thought</h2>
      <p class="selfpara">
        Regarding Buddhism, the way in which it’s understood in the west has a
        layered and complex history. Because interpretations differ per person,
        it’s impossible to describe one understanding for a whole tradition.
        Nevertheless, what I can settle on is the way in which Buddhism often is
        commercialised and trivialised. A somewhat biased fascination in
        mystical Eastern religions — by Romanticism and the hippie culture — was
        influential in the development of this misinterpretation. Together with
        other traditions, Buddhism can become generalised under the umbrella
        term: “spirituality”. This, besides a certain iconography, could also be
        associated with an individual — and sometimes less committed — approach
        to spiritual practices.
        <br></br></p> 
        <p class="selfpara">An institution that is positioned between a
        contemporary individualistic and a traditional approach to Buddhism is
        <span class="italics">Zen.nl</span>. This network of Zen-Buddhist centres offers various products,
        courses and activities related to meditation and Self-help. It states on
        its website that its mission is <span class="italics">“to facilitate as many people as
        possible in achieving sustainable happiness”</span>. Since its foundation in
        1987, this organisation has helped over 30,000 people learn how to
        meditate. Their website provides empirical data stating the effect of
        their services. In a topic on their website, participants send in images
        related to its title: <span class="italics">‘Zen Photo of the Week’</span> <span class="italics">(figure 12)</span>. Even though I
        can’t be sure of the thought behind the submitted images, they seem to
        depict a feeling associated with peacefulness, with the feeling of being
        Zen. It shows a depiction of an experience. While mainstream portrayals
        of “spirituality” often lean toward amalgamating branding decisions —
        which are in a way interpretations — <span class="italics">‘Zen Photo of the Week’</span> reflects a
        more modest, authentic expression of an interpretation of spirituality.
        A pattern I tend to notice is because the approach zen.nl offers stays
        relatively close to the original tradition that is honoured,
        romanticisation and fusion with other traditions is less present.
        Therefore, the connotation — to Buddhist tradition — of the participants
        seems only lightly romanticised and free from amalgamation. As an
        addition to this envisioned theory, institutions which remain closest to
        the original Buddhist tradition in the Netherlands seem to be even more
        distant from romanticisation and stick to a traditional expression of
        their practice. The He Hua Temple for example promotes itself without
        any exaggerated design: no depictions of a feeling or anything
        decorative, only an informative representation of the tradition.
        Obviously, this envisioned pattern doesn’t conclude anything, but it
        feels like the closer to the original approach — and commitment — the
        less likely it is to spread an image of Buddhism — and other traditions
        — that can lead to misinterpretation, or even a skeptical attitude
        toward spiritual practices as seen with the Soulsisters. However, this
        skepticism could potentially get refuted, as spirituality could gain
        more acknowledgement — ironically — backed by science.

        As I said, ideas
        about <span class="italics">“how everything is connected”</span> often aren’t taken seriously, but
        what seemed like just an idea only is now <span class="italics">“somewhat scientifically
        proven”</span>.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-31" href="#fn-31">31</a></sup> Carlo Rovelli and Bernardo Kastrup have a background in quantum
        physics — the study of the smallest particles — but are now regarded as
        philosophers due to the metaphysical theories their branch of science
        tends to offer. They both strongly promote ideas of an interconnected
        world: a world in which things aren’t independent but exist as a
        connected whole. Rovelli’s theory of <span class="italics">Relational thinking</span> could be
        considered a contemporary expression of spirituality due to its
        explanation of this idea.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-32" href="#fn-32">32</a></sup> A theory which states an explanation of
        reality very similar to <span class="italics">‘the truth of cessation of suffering’</span> as the
        Buddha tells. 
        <br></br></p>
        <p class="selfpara"> The notion of <span class="italics">buen vivir</span> challenges the dichotomy of human
        and nature according to Vázquez.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-33" href="#fn-33">33</a></sup> Because it’s based on relation between
        human and nature, instead of modern thoughts of separation. I simply
        can’t measure the influence of science on western thinking. But
        according to both Kastrup and Vázquez, it has a significant influence on
        western thinking or <span class="italics">modernity</span>. Therefore — according to Vázquez —
        breaking with the metaphysical background of science can be viewed as
        fundamental in the process of breaking with <span class="italics">modernity</span>. Whether by
        decolonisation, or by listening to a scientifically accepted worldview —
        that quantum physics offers — the idea of interconnectedness and
        relation seems to be a returning theme. Therefore, the way in which <span class="italics">buen
        vivir</span> challenges a western worldview, can be applied to Buddhism — or
        spirituality — and modernity as well. As it perpetuates
        interconnectedness between human, spirit and nature, instead of the
        philosophical assumption of things existing independently — metaphysical
        materialism — which is dominant in science.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-34" href="#fn-34">34</a></sup> Even though Romantic
        philosophers came long before me. By sticking to only an open attitude,
        the romanticisation of other worldviews — such as that of Buddhist
        tradition — can be prevented and ideas about interconnectedness could
        maybe be perceived as realistic.

        It’s a train of thought, I potentially
        could apply to my practice as a designer as well. For example by
        deepening my understanding for traditions that have researched and
        theorised the relation between matter and spirit, like Alchemy. The
        golden ratio seems to be a formula for nature and when applied to art it
        can make a composition feel natural. This is an example of how there are
        techniques able to manipulate the way eyes perceive things. A technique
        that works on everyone’s eyes and therefore emphasises connection. In
        the context of communication through graphic design, I want to research
        techniques, references, shapes and textures that emphasise this
        connection.
